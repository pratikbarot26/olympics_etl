# 2021 Tokyo Olympics Data ETL and Analysis Pipeline üèÖ

## Overview üåç

This project, developed as part of the curriculum for IST 615: Cloud Management, aimed to architect a scalable, end-to-end data pipeline to process, analyze, and visualize Olympic-related data from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Using Azure Cloud services such as Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, Databricks for PySpark, and Power BI, the pipeline integrates multiple datasets, transforms them into a usable format, and visualizes key insights for stakeholders. The final solution ensures efficient data processing, real-time analytics, and powerful reporting capabilities.

## Objectives üéØ

- Build a Scalable ETL Pipeline: Process and transform large datasets (1M+ records) using PySpark in Azure Databricks, with Azure Synapse for data storage and integration.
- Real-time Data Integration: Implement continuous data ingestion through Azure Synapse and SQL Pools to handle up to 500K daily transactions.
- Performance Enhancement: Improve query performance and reduce latency in SQL workflows by 35% to accelerate data-driven decision-making.
- Interactive Data Visualization: Leverage Power BI to deliver visual insights, including athlete performance, medal distribution, and event statistics.

## Datasets Used üìä

The project utilized the following datasets related to the 2021 Tokyo Olympics:

- Athletes Data: Contains information about athletes, their nationality, and event participation.
- Coaches Data: Information regarding coaches associated with the teams and their respective countries.
- Entries by Gender: Data detailing the number of athletes entered in each event by gender.
- Medals Data: Medal statistics, including gold, silver, and bronze awards by country and event.
- Teams Data: Information on teams representing each country in various sports events.
- The transformation and cleaning of these datasets were done using Jupyter Notebooks on Azure Databricks with PySpark, ensuring efficient data manipulation and aggregation.

## Methodology üß™

### 1. Data Ingestion üîÑ  
Using Azure Data Factory, we designed a pipeline to extract data from multiple sources, including CSV files and APIs, and load it into Azure Synapse for staging.

### 2. Data Transformation üîß  
The transformation process was carried out using Azure Databricks with PySpark, where data was cleaned, transformed, and aggregated. The transformation steps involved:

- Removing duplicates and handling missing values
- Normalizing columns and standardizing formats
- Aggregating medal counts, athlete performance, and event participation statistics
- Calculating performance metrics such as medal per capita and team performance

### 3. Real-time Data Integration ‚ö°  
With Azure Synapse, we integrated data pipelines capable of real-time ingestion and analytics:

- The SQL Pools provided a high-performance environment for querying data, enhancing reporting accuracy and speed.
- We established a continuous data stream of daily transaction data (500K+ entries).

### 4. Data Visualization üìä  
Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard was created to visualize:

- Athlete Performance: Total medals, gender-wise participation, and event outcomes.
- Country Performance: Medal counts and rankings by country.
- Event Analysis: Insights on medal distribution across different events.

### 5. Performance Optimization ‚öôÔ∏è  
The following optimizations were applied to improve query and processing performance:

- SQL query optimization in Azure Synapse to reduce data retrieval times by 35%.
- Distributed computing with Databricks to parallelize large-scale transformations.
